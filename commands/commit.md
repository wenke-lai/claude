- description: Generate a commit message from staged changes (ask before committing)
  allowed-tools: Bash(git status:_), Bash(git diff:_), Bash(git log:_), Bash(git commit:_)
-

## Context

- git status:
  !`git status`

- staged diff:
  !`git diff --cached`

- recent commits:
  !`git log --oneline -10`

## Task

1. Propose ONE commit message (prefer Conventional Commits: feat/fix/refactor/chore/docs/test/build).
2. Keep the subject line <= 72 chars, imperative mood.
3. Do NOT add any AI attribution (e.g. "Generated with ...")
4. Ask me to confirm the final message.
5. Only after I confirm, run: `git commit -m "<message>"`.

## Example

`feat(cms): add page management system with tree structure`
